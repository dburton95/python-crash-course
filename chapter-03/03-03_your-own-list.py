##Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. 
# Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.” ##

cars = ['delorean', 'honda prelude', 'nissan frontier']

message = f"If I had a {cars[0].title()} I would call it Dorian's {cars[0].title()}"
print(message)

message = f"I talked to someone at a red light recently about their {cars[1].title()}"
print(message)

message = f"I recently bought a {cars[2].title()}"
print(message)

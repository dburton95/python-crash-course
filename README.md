# python-crash-course - ARCHIVE

THIS IS AN ARCHIVE
I wrote these scripts a considerably long time ago and put the book down. I plan to start it from the beginning in the main branch.

A repository for use along side the Python Crash Course book

This is a repository I'm using to learn Python. I'm using the book Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Eric Matthes to learn.
In this repository I will be storing code written from the challenges the book offers.
